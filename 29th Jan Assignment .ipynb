    "Ans : In Python, memory management is automatic and handled by the Python memory manager. The memory manager is responsible for allocating memory for new objects, deallocating memory when objects are no longer needed, and managing the size of the memory pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a reference counting system to keep track of the number of references to an object. When the reference count for an object drops to zero, the memory manager automatically frees the memory associated with that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a garbage collector to periodically search for objects that are no longer needed and reclaim their memory. The garbage collector runs in the background and automatically frees memory that is no longer being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automatic memory management makes it easier to write Python programs, as you don't have to worry about freeing memory manually. It also helps to prevent memory leaks, as memory is automatically freed when it is no longer needed.\n",
